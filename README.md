1. In Scenario 1, where users can create and edit stages for a particular board, the primary changes will involve updating the tables and API endpoints related to stages.

**Tables:**
   **Stage Table:**
   - **Attributes:**
     - Stage ID (Unique identifier for the stage)
     - Board ID (Identifier for the board this stage belongs to)
     - Name (Name of the stage, e.g., ToDo, Working, Reviewing, Completed)
     - Position (Order of the stage in the board)
   - Each board will have multiple stages associated with it.

**API Endpoints:**
1. **Create Stage:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /boards/{boardId}/stages`
   - Will allow users to create a new stage for a specific board.
   - Request Body: Stage details (name, position, etc.).
   - Response: New stage details.

2. **Update Stage:**
   - Endpoint: `PUT /boards/{boardId}/stages/{stageId}`
   - Will allow users to update an existing stage for a specific board.
   - Request Body: Updated stage details (name, position, etc.).
   - Response: Updated stage details.

3. **Delete Stage:**
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /boards/{boardId}/stages/{stageId}`
   - Will allow users to delete a stage from a specific board.
   - Response: Success message.

4. **Get Stages for a Board:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /boards/{boardId}/stages`
   - Will allow users to retrieve all stages associated with a specific board.
   - Response: List of stages for the specified board.

By implementing these changes, users will be able to customize the stages for each board according to their specific requirements. The stages will be associated with a particular board, and they can create, update, or delete stages as needed.

2. In Scenario 2, where users can comment on tasks, we need to introduce a new table for comments and create corresponding API endpoints to manage these comments.
**Tables:**
   **Comment Table:**
   - **Attributes:**
     - Comment ID (Unique identifier for the comment)
     - Task ID (Identifier for the task this comment belongs to)
     - User ID (Identifier for the user who made the comment)
     - Content (Actual content of the comment)
     - Timestamp (Time when the comment was created)
   - Each task can have multiple associated comments.

**API Endpoints:**
1. **Create Comment:**
   - Endpoint: `POST /tasks/{taskId}/comments`
   - Will allow users to create a new comment for a specific task.
   - Request Body: Comment details (content, user ID, etc.).
   - Response: New comment details.

2. **Update Comment:**
   - Endpoint: `PUT /comments/{commentId}`
   - AWill allow users to update an existing comment.
   - Request Body: Updated comment details (content, etc.).
   - Response: Updated comment details.

3. **Delete Comment:**
   - Endpoint: `DELETE /comments/{commentId}`
   - Will allow users to delete a comment.
   - Response: Success message.

4. **Get Comments for a Task:**
   - Endpoint: `GET /tasks/{taskId}/comments`
   - Will allow users to retrieve all comments associated with a specific task.
   - Response: List of comments for the specified task.

By implementing these changes, users will be able to comment on individual tasks. Comments will be associated with a specific task and can be created, updated, or deleted by the users. This enhances collaboration and communication within the task management system.

3. Will do error handling using HTTP Status Codes returned by the server (e.g., 200 for success, 400 for client error, 500 for server error). will use Axios interceptors to globally handle errors and responses from API calls. Using React Error Boundaries to catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors. Displaing a fallback UI to the user in case of errors within a specific component. Handling scenarios where the user's device loses network connectivity during an API call. Willl write automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) to cover error scenarios and ensure proper error handling in different parts of the application.
